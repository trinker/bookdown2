\chapter{Heading of Test Chapter 1}\label{testchapterone}

This is a chapter of the book for testing. It has code to be executed,
and citations to be processed. The code produces a plot (Figure 1.1).

We are testing to see if a bib file and a csl can be used with the
bookdown package to produce chapters that have a reference list at the
end.

Some of the best recent books on R include Hadley Wickham's `Advanced R'
(2014). He also has a very useful book on R packages (Wickham, 2015).
