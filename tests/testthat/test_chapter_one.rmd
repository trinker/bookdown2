# Heading of Test Chapter 1 {#testchapterone}

This is a chapter of the book for testing. It has code to be executed, and citations to be processed. The code produces a plot (`r ref$fig("random_data", display = "cite")`).

We are testing to see if a bib file and a csl can be used with the bookdown package to produce chapters that have a reference list at the end.

```{r simple_plot}
plot(rnorm(1000))
```

`r ref$fig(name = "random_data", caption = "Plot of 100 values randomly sampled from a normal distribution.")`

Some of the best recent books on R include Hadley Wickham's 'Advanced R' [-@wickham2014advanced]. He also has a very useful book on R packages [@wickham2015packages].
