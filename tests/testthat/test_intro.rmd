# Heading of Test Introduction {#testintro}

This is the introduction to the book.

## Building the PDF {#buildingpdf}

To build the PDF of this book, look in the `book` directory and run the `build-book.r` script. You'll need pandoc, pandoc-citeproc, xelatex, the inconsolata font and the bookdown2 package.

## Building the website {#buildingsite}

To build the HTML pages for this book, open a terminal in the directory that contains this file, and run `sudo jekyll build` and then look in the `_site` directory for the files (which can then be put online), or run `sudo jekyll serve --watch` to see how the HTML looks when provided by a webserver at http://localhost:4000 This is useful for iterative work, when you want to make small changes and see how they look right away. 

## Adding a new chapter {#addingchapter}

When a new chapter is added, the `includes/package-nav.html` file needs to be manually updated, and run `index()` in this dirctory to remake the toc files. And manually update the `book/test_book.tex` to add the new chapter to make sure it's included in the PDF. 

The new chapter must have front-matter like this:

```

title: "Test Introduction"

```

Followed by this chunk that takes care of figure captions and cross-references. This gives table and figures numbers like 2.3, for chapter two, figure three.

<pre>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r, caption_numering, echo = FALSE}
chapter_number <- 0 # edit this to match the actual chapter number
ref <- list(
  fig = pryr::partial(captioner::captioner, 
  prefix = paste0("Figure ", chapter_number, "."), auto_space = FALSE)(),
  tbl = pryr::partial(captioner::captioner, p
  refix = paste0("Table ", chapter_number, "."), auto_space = FALSE)()
    )
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>

See the rmarkdown source file for how to use the caption and cross-referencing.
