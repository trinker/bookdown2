# Heading of Test Introduction {#testintro}

This is the introduction to the book.

## Building the PDF

To build the PDF of this book, look in the `book` directory and run the `build-book.r` script. You'll need pandoc, pandoc-citeproc, xelatex, the inconsolata font and the bookdown2 package.

## Building the website

To build the HTML pages for this book, open a terminal in the directory that contains this file, and run `sudo jekyll build` and then look in the `_site` directory for the files (which can then be put online), or run `sudo jekyll serve --watch` to see how the HTML looks when provided by a webserver at http://localhost:4000 This is useful for iterative work, when you want to make small changes and see how they look right away. 

## Adding a new chapter

When a new chapter is added, the `includes/package-nav.html` file needs to be manually updated, and run `index()` in this dirctory to remake the toc files. And manually update the `book/test_book.tex` to add the new chapter to make sure it's included in the PDF. 

The new chapter must have front-matter like this:
