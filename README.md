# Bookdown2

The bookdown2 package is useful for writing Rmarkdown files and converting them into a book. You can render a set of HTML pages with a linked table of contents, or produce a PDF. This package also has basic support for scholarly citations and reference lists (using pandoc), and for table and figure captions and cross-references (using the captioner package)
